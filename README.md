# DS_ML_1
DA2: Introduction to machine learning #1

The goal of the course is to provide students with knowledge of statistics fundamentals and skills
necessary to build models for supervised machine learning (ML).
The objectives of the course are to:
 Learn the fundamentals of math statistics necessary for ML;
 Learn the fundamentals of ML;
 observe and learn the theoretical concepts of supervised ML algorithms;
 learn to build and implement the ML models on practical tasks
Learning outcomes of the course
Students successfully completing the course will be able to:
 perform Exploratory Data Analyses (EDA)
 implement basic ML algorithms from the supervised learning methods;
 recognize the type of the task and make proved decision on the appropriate methods and
algorithms;
 apply ML algorithms for binary/multiclass classification and regression problems;
implement solution of the problem using chosen algorithms in familiar programming and analytic
environment
